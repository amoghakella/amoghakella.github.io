        <h1>Handouts</h1>  
        <p>Since the 2024-25 school year, I have been the head coach for my local middle school's MATHCOUNTS team. This has led to the creation of many handouts on specific subjects, which have problems from previous MATHCOUNTS and AMC tests, as well as problems I have written myself. These handouts are designed to be slightly harder than late MATHCOUNTS and AMC problems. </p>
