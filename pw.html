        <h1>Problem Writing</h1>  
        <p>I've problem written for many competitions. I am the co-head of problem development for <a href="https://www.integirls.org">inteGIRLS</a>, and I'm also on the <a href="https://www.ommcofficial.org">OMMC</a> staff team. I also recently helped edit the <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/mockaime.html">OTIS Mock AIME</a>, as well as proposing a problem that went on the test. </p>
