        <h1>Chess</h1>  
        <p>From 7th-10th grade, I played chess competitively. Now, I just play it for fun. During my competitive chess years, I placed well in many scholastic tournaments and also won my class in the 2023 Southwest Class Championships. My favorite Chess openings to play with white are the Italian (played aggressively with d4) and the Scotch Gambit. With black, I enjoy playing the French Defense and the French Sicilian. </p>
